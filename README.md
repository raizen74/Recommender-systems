# Recommender-systems
Recommender systems in the movielens dataset implemented in Python. I implemented 4 recomendation approaches:

- Non personalized

- Content based, a Naive Bayes spam filter is also implemented.

- Colaborative filtering, item-item and user-user.

- Colaborative filtering using the surprise library.
